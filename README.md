AI agents can sometimes hallucinate when working in a multi-agent environment, this project is meant to test that using three agents.

## Dependencies

1. **crewAI**- Open source framework for building and orchestrating groups of specialized collaborative agents
    - The AI agents have a role, backstory and a goal that defines its behaviours (What it can do and what it can't do), Tne Agents can be given tasks to perform with limits.
